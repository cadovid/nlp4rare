# Project NLP4Rare-cm-uc3m

This repository contains the data and code created under the project NLP4Rare-cm-uc3m. Its main objective is to cover the main relevant NLP tasks on a customised corpus oriented towards rare diseases and their clinical manifestations: the RareDis corpus.

A description of the corpus can be found in:
